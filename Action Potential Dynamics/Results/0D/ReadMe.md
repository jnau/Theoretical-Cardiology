These images are graphs made on Microsoft Excel using data obtained from the S1S2 protocol. The first two letters of each picture denote which ion channel is being changed, as well as the percentage change in conductance. Here, 100% denotes our control. Dots in read indicate our results obtained from the simulation, with a line of best fit along with its slope.
