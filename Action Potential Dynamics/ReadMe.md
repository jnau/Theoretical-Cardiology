# Nonlinear Action Potential Dynamics involving APD Alternans and its relation to Cardiac Arrhythmias
Project under supervision of D. Sato, Ph.D, Lab website (https://dsatolab.github.io/Site/). Studied how phenomena from the slope of the APD restitution curve in 0D correlated to 2D spiral wave break up and reentry. Information on how this project was conducted and concluded, refer to the projects tab.

## Project Description/ Abstract
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the major leading causes of deaths in the United States and is known to be caused by abnormalities of heart rhythm, or cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia. Researchers found action potential duration (APD) to be an important factor to consider due to a connection between cardiac arrhythmias and APD alternans, which are APDs alternating in long-short intervals for every heartbeat. We examined the nonlinear dynamics of a rabbit heart model computationally and how the change in the conductance of ion channels affected the formation of action potentials. We then determined the APD restitution curve from a single cell model by using computer simulations. The steepness of this curve correlated to the appearance and break-up of spiral waves within the tissue model and the instabilities in the membrane voltages that create APD alternans. Using this, we can theoretically predict how APD alternans appear, establish the severity of a cardiac arrhythmia without actual experimentation or patient contact, and decide where the best area to consider innovative treatments would be.
