# Calcium Dynamics - Results

## 1D
Contains videos corresponding to our 1D simulation of Calcium Sparks and waves with different changes to our model such as an over active SERCA pump. 

## 2D
Contains videos corresponding to our 2D simulation of Calcium Sparks and waves with different parameter changes in our model. Note that the quality of these videos were diminished due to their large size and had to be resized. The plots illustrating spark frequency and wave propagation speed are also found here. 

## Diffusion
This folder contains any pre-simulation work that had to be completed before starting the project. This mainly includes modeling random walk diffusion in different dimensions and in comparison to the PDE solution.
